                        <p class="lead">Tanner's treatment was over on December 25th, 2015. Almost a decade later, he continues his life as a survivor.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                        Although the diagnosis of cancer sounds like it should be a person's only life focus, it is only a tiny part of who they are and not the sum of one's life. This is especially true for Tanner.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                          Cancer was a diagnosis but not a sentence. Tanner is a brother and now a husband. He is a son, an uncle, a college graduate, and a business owner. Tanner loves Jesus and others with a tenacity that is more significant than most because he knows that life is short, which makes it valuable and unique.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                          He beat cancer, but unfortunately, his mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, and after a long battle, she passed away in October of 2017, shortly after his 16th birthday. This was a setback after seeing his mom going through the same treatments that he went through a short time before. But Tanner didn't let this stop him. He finished high school at the top of his class, marrying his high-school sweetheart in October 2023. He will graduate college in May 2024 with a degree in Bio-Chemistry and Biology. His next adventure is medical school, where he hopes to become an oncologist and maybe even cure cancer someday.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                          No matter what life may put in his way, Tanner will meet the challenges head-on and succeed. After all, he has gone from being a survivor to becoming a thriver.
